		<h2>Welcome to Devi Ahilya Vishwavidyalaya</h2>
		<p class="description"> Devi Ahilya Vishwavidyalaya (informally abbreviated DAVV), formerly University of Indore,[2] is a state university located in Indore, India. It was named after Ahilya Bai Holkar, the 18th century Queen and ruler of Indore, daughter in law of Malhar Rao Holkar who was the founder of Holkar Dynasty.

			The university's jurisdiction was initially restricted to Indore city. Later on, its jurisdiction was extended to seven tribal-dominated districts of Indore division namely, Jhabua, Alirajpur, Dhar, Khargone, Khandwa, Burhanpur and Barwani. It is thus catering to the educational needs of the most industrially developed district of Madhya Pradesh, Indore on one hand and to the seven tribal and rural backward districts of the State on the other.</p>
